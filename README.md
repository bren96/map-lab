# Map-lab

This monorepo contains the open-source projets developed for [Map-lab](https://Map-lab.info/), a web-based collaborative mapping platform. Use Map-lab to create, edit, and share maps and data with others in real-time.

## Development Setup

Map-lab uses the [Nx](https://nx.dev) build system.

If using VSCode or any editor that supports the [Development Container Open Specification](https://containers.dev/supporting), a containerized workspace is available to ensure a consistent development environment. The development container is optional, but [provides many benefits](https://containers.dev/overview) to developers and maintainers.

To use the development container, refer to your specific editor/extension's instructions. The container spec is located at:

`./devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

To install all required packages, run:

`npm install`

Note: Each app or library may have specific setup requirements.

## Usage

See the `./Makefile` for common monorepo commands and maintenance tasks.

Note: Specific project documentation is located in each app or library directory.

## CI/CD

All PRs are tested using Github Actions and scanned by SonarCloud.
SonarCloud calculates Code Coverage using reports generated by each project.
Code Coverage repots must be generated in LCOV.

## Contributing

Map-lab is maintained by MAP-LAB, LLC.

We welcome feature requests, bug reports, and pull requests from the community.

Take a look at open issues to see if there are bugs or features you are interested in working on.
