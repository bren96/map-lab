# MAP-LAB

This monorepo contains the open-source projets developed for [MAP-LAB](https://map-lab.info/), a web-based collaborative mapping platform. Use MAP-LAB to create, edit, and share maps and data with others in real-time.

## Development Setup

MAP-LAB uses the [Nx](https://nx.dev) build system.

If using VSCode or any editor that supports the [Development Container Open Specification](https://containers.dev/supporting), a containerized workspace is available to ensure a consistent development environment. The development container is optional, but [provides many benefits](https://containers.dev/overview) to developers and maintainers.

To use the development container, refer to your specific editor/extension's instructions. The container spec is located at:

`./devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

To install all required packages, run:

`npm install`

Note: Each app or library may have specific setup requirements.

## Usage

See the `./Makefile` for common monorepo commands and maintenance tasks.

Note: Specific project documentation is located in each app or library directory.
